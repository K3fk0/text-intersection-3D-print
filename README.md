# text-intersection-3D-print

This project is created as extension for Blender.

It creates panel for creating 3D text intersection objects. Those are availible for exporting to stl files for 3D print.

Texts in Blender can also have different files, but only usage of attached font AGENCYB.TTF will guarantee maximum efficiency.
